# Project Architecture For Medication Trend and Biosimilar Impact Analysis

## Introduction
In the evolving landscape of healthcare, managing medication costs is a critical challenge for both healthcare providers and policymakers. This analysis dives into the trends of medication costs from 2018 to 2021, focusing on understanding the factors driving these costs and evaluating the impact of biosimilar drugs on overall healthcare expenses. By analyzing historical data, this study aims to provide insights that can guide future strategies for cost management and policy development in the healthcare sector.

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of trends in medication costs and the impact of biosimilars on the total cost of medical benefit drugs from 2018 to 2021. The analysis aims to identify the major reasons for the increase in medication costs, evaluate the effect of biosimilars on overall expenses in 2021.

## Objectives
The analysis focuses on understanding the :
- total change in medication cost PMPM between 2018 and 2021
- top 10 medications with the highest PMPM increases between 2018 and 2021,
- major reasons behind the increase in medication costs from 2018 to 2021,
- evaluating the impact of biosimilar medications on 2021 expenses.

### Key Questions Addressed
1. **Total Change in Medication Cost PMPM (Per Member Per Month) Between 2018 and 2021**: Analyzing the overall cost trends.
2. **Top 10 Medications with Highest PMPM Increases**: Identifying the key drivers of cost increases.
3. **Impact of Increased Payment for Entyvio**: Determining the extent to which the cost increase was driven by more patients using the medication versus an increase in per-patient cost.
4. **Impact of Biosimilars on 2021 Expenses**: Assessing the cost savings achieved through the use of biosimilars instead of reference products.
5. **Forecasting Future Trends**: Projecting future trends in medication costs and biosimilar adoption using historical data from 2018 to 2021.

## Data Description
- **Dataset 1: Medication Cost Data**
  - **Features:** `Year`, `BENES_FFS_CNT`, `Member_Months`, `Tot_Spndng`, `PMPM`, `HCPCS_Cd`, `HCPCS_Desc`, `Brnd_Name`, `Gnrc_Name`, etc.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: For data cleaning, analysis, and calculations.
- **PowerPoint**: For presenting the findings.

## Methodology
- **PMPM Cost Analysis**: The per-member per-month costs of medications between 2018 and 2021 were compared to identify overall trends.
- **Top 10 Medications Analysis**: Identified the top 10 medications with the highest PMPM increases and analyzed the contributing factors.
- **Entyvio Payment Increase Breakdown**: Analyzed the drivers behind the $283 million increase in payment for Entyvio between 2018 and 2021, focusing on utilization and per-patient cost.
- **Biosimilar Impact Evaluation**: Analyzed cost savings in 2021 by comparing the actual costs to hypothetical costs if biosimilars were not used.

## Findings
- **Medication Cost Trends**: Significant increases in medication costs were observed, driven by factors such as increased usage and higher per-patient costs.
- **Top 10 Medications**: Keytruda showed the highest PMPM increase, followed by other significant medications.
- **Entyvio Payment Increase**: The majority of the payment increase for Entyvio was due to higher utilization rather than an increase in per-patient cost.
- **Biosimilar Savings**: The use of biosimilars in 2021 led to substantial cost savings, with an estimated total savings of **$307 million**. The most significant savings were observed with Herceptin, which alone accounted for approximately **$154 million** in cost reductions. However, not all biosimilars led to savings; for example, Neulasta had a negative impact, resulting in a cost increase of **$43 million**.

## Practical Applications
- **Healthcare Strategy Development**:
    - Insights from this analysis can guide healthcare providers and insurers in making informed decisions on resource allocation and cost management.
    - The analysis suggests continued growth in medication costs, with biosimilar adoption expected to play a significant role in mitigating these increases.

- **Policy Recommendations**: The findings can support public health strategies aimed at optimizing medication costs through the adoption of biosimilars and preparing for future trends in medication expenses.
